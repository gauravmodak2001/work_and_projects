## Edge A.I Based Solar Panel Robot Assistant

This is a Final Year Industry sponsored project in which we have Built a convolution neural network model to assist and automate solar panel cleaning(Health monitoring) by training on 45000+ image dataset. A model can able to analyze and predict whether the solar panel needs to be cleaned or not and perform cleaning operations accordingly. The model size is compressed down below 100kb to deploy on the Edge device(Low memory fewer ram microcontrollers) (Undergraduate final year project).
