Subject: Data Quality Assessment and Recommendations

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. We appreciate the opportunity to work with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd and are committed to ensuring that your data is of the highest quality to support our analysis in phase two. As per our recent discussions, I have conducted a thorough review of the three datasets provided: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data for the past three months. In this email, I will outline the data quality issues identified and propose strategies to mitigate these issues for a more robust analysis.

Data Quality Issues:

Completeness:

In the Customer Demographic dataset, there are missing values in the "DOB" (Date of Birth) column.
The Customer Addresses dataset also contains some missing values in the "State" and "Postcode" columns.
Transaction data is generally complete but may require a cross-reference check with the Customer datasets to ensure all transactions are associated with valid customers.
Accuracy:

There are instances of inaccurate or inconsistent data in the "gender" column of the Customer Demographic dataset. For example, some entries are marked as "U" (Unknown), which may need clarification.
In the Customer Addresses dataset, there are instances where the same address is associated with multiple customers, suggesting a potential data duplication issue.
Consistency:

The "gender" column in the Customer Demographic dataset uses a mix of formats, such as "F" and "Female." Standardizing this data would improve consistency.
Transaction data may have inconsistent date formats or units of measurement, which should be harmonized for analysis.
Timeliness:

It's important to ensure that the datasets are up-to-date. The Transaction data should be regularly updated to maintain its relevance for analysis.
Strategies to Mitigate Data Quality Issues:

Completeness:

For missing values, we recommend exploring options for data imputation, such as using statistical methods or consulting with your team to gather missing information.
Accuracy:

To address gender inconsistencies, we suggest standardizing the gender codes and validating them against a predefined list of accepted values.
For data duplication in Customer Addresses, a deduplication process should be performed to eliminate redundant entries.
Consistency:

Standardize data formats (e.g., date formats, units of measurement) to ensure consistency throughout the datasets.
Create a data dictionary or schema to document and enforce data standards across the organization.
Timeliness:

Implement a regular data update schedule for the Transaction dataset to ensure that the analysis is based on the most recent data.
We will work closely with your team to address these data quality issues and provide ongoing support to maintain data quality throughout our analysis. Additionally, please find attached a Data Quality Framework Table that outlines specific criteria and dimensions we considered in our assessment.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are committed to delivering the highest-quality insights for your business.

Thank you for your trust in our expertise, and we look forward to helping you achieve your data analysis goals.

Best Regards,
